### Task: Build with Spring Boot MVC

This project is built using **Spring Boot MVC**, leveraging the power of Spring Boot to simplify the setup and configuration of a Spring MVC application. It follows the **Model-View-Controller** architecture, ensuring a clean separation between the user interface, business logic, and data layers.

Key features:
- **Spring Boot** simplifies project setup with embedded servers (like Tomcat or Jetty) and automatic configuration.
- **Spring MVC** is used to handle HTTP requests, map them to controllers, and return appropriate views or data.
- **Controller** annotations (`@RestController`, `@Controller`) are used to define request mappings.
- **Model** components represent the application's data, processed through business logic layers.
- **View** layer can be implemented using Postman tool.
- Automatic application configuration using `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
